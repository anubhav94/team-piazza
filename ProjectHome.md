## Public life in the Team City ##

Piazza is a build monitor plugin for the [Team City](http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/) [continuous integration](http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html) server.  Piazza provides a [high-visibility display](Screenshots.md) of the current state of the build to alert the team as soon as the build breaks.


For any build, Piazza displays:

  * The project and build name
  * The current build number
  * Whether the build is "red" or "green"
  * Textual success/failure indication for the colour-blind
  * Whether the Team City server is currently building
  * The changes that caused the current build to be kicked off
  * Pictures of the team members that made those changes
  * The progress of the build
  * The build step that the Team City agent is currently running
  * The number of passed, failed and ignored tests

Piazza can also display an overview of all the builds in a project.
