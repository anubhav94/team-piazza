Here's how Piazza shows the state of the build as a change is made, built, fails and is fixed.  Piazza displays are web pages and can be viewed in any web browser.  However, they are usually displayed full-screen on monitors around the team's working area.  Both options are shown in the screenshots below.

The build is currently clean and the last build was kicked off by change checked in by Nat.

Nat checks in another change, and Piazza shows the running build as soon as it starts:

Oops!  Nat's commit broke the build.  Around the work area all the Piazza screens go bright red.

Embarrassed, Nat quickly corrects his mistake and checks in the fix.  Piazza shows the new fix being built.  It looks okay so far...

Great!  Nat fixed the build.  The Piazza screens go green again.  They show all the changes built since the previous _successful_ build.
